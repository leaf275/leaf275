- 👋 Hi, I’m @leaf275
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, reading, speedcubing, martial arts, and many more
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding, I want to create this github because I recently learnt that you can't memorise everything, and it's good to have a organised catalog, and GitHub was the most recommended.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now, after I learn a bit more of python, I might start up some projects, and it would be fun to do with other people sure!
- 📫 How to reach me: infinityranbir@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love the martial art of Muay Thai.
